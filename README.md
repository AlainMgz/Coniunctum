- Install Instructions works on Linux and Windows, should also on Mac but not tested. Also works on Android using Termux:
  - Requirements : 
    - Install Python 3+ (or make sure you have it, `python3 -V` should output something similar to `Python 3.9.2`, this program is using `python3` and not `python`)
    - Clone this repository or download the latest verison [here](https://github.com/AlainMgz/Coniunctum/releases) 
    - Install the needed pip packages with : `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Run the client with `python3 coniunctum.py`.
  - For now the client only works on local networks.
